 powerquality  power quality determines the fitness of electric power to consumer devices synchronization of the voltage frequency and phase allows electrical systems to function in their intended manner without significant loss of performance or life the term is used to describe electric power that drives an electrical load and the loads ability to function properly without the proper power an electrical device or load may malfunction fail prematurely or not operate at all there are many ways in which electric power can be of poor quality and many more causes of such poor quality power the electric power industry comprises electricity generation ac power electric power transmission and ultimately electric power distribution to an electricity meter located at the premises of the end user of the electric power the electricity then moves through the wiring system of the end user until it reaches the load the complexity of the system to move electric energy from the point of production to the point of consumption combined with variations in weather generation demand and other factors provide many opportunities for the quality of supply to be compromised while power quality is a convenient term for many it is the quality of the voltage—rather than power or electric current—that is actually described by the term power is simply the flow of energy and the current demanded by a load is largely uncontrollable   the quality of electrical power may be described as a set of values of parameters such as  it is often useful to think of power quality as a compatibility problem  is the equipment connected to the grid compatible with the events on the grid and is the power delivered by the grid including the events compatible with the equipment that is connected compatibility problems always have at least two solutions  in this case either clean up the power or make the equipment tougher the tolerance of data-processing equipment to voltage variations is often characterized by the cbema curve which give the duration and magnitude of voltage variations that can be tolerated ideally ac voltage is supplied by a utility as sinusoidal having an amplitude and frequency given by national standards in the case of mains or system specifications in the case of a power feed not directly attached to the mains with an impedance of zero ohms at all frequencies no real-life power source is ideal and generally can deviate in at least the following ways  each of these power quality problems has a different cause some problems are a result of the shared infrastructure for example a fault on the network may cause a dip that will affect some customers the higher the level of the fault the greater the number affected a problem on one customers site may cause a transient that affects all other customers on the same subsystem problems such as harmonics arise within the customers own installation and may propagate onto the network and affect other customers harmonic problems can be dealt with by a combination of good design practice and well proven reduction equipment power conditioning is modifying the power to improve its quality an uninterruptible power supply can be used to switch off of mains power if there is a transient temporary condition on the line however cheaper ups units create poor-quality power themselves akin to imposing a higher-frequency and lower-amplitude square wave atop the sine wave high-quality ups units utilize a double conversion topology which breaks down incoming ac power into dc charges the batteries then remanufactures an ac sine wave this remanufactured sine wave is of higher quality than the original ac power feed a surge protector or simple capacitor or varistor can protect against most overvoltage conditions while a lightning arrester protects against severe spikes electronic filters can remove harmonics modern systems use sensors called phasor measurement units pmu distributed throughout their network to monitor power quality and in some cases respond automatically to them using such smart grids features of rapid sensing and automated self healing of anomalies in the network promises to bring higher quality power and less downtime while simultaneously supporting power from intermittent power sources and distributed generation which would if unchecked degrade power quality
