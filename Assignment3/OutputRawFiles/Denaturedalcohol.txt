 denaturedalcohol  denatured alcohol also called methylated spirits or denatured rectified spirit is ethanol that has additives to make it poisonous somewhat bad tasting foul smelling or nauseating to discourage recreational consumption in some cases it is also dyed denatured alcohol is used as a solvent and as fuel for alcohol burners and camping stoves because of the diversity of industrial uses for denatured alcohol hundreds of additives and denaturing methods have been used the main additive has traditionally been 10% methanol giving rise to the term methylated spirits other typical additives include isopropyl alcohol acetone methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone and denatonium denaturing alcohol does not chemically alter the ethanol molecule rather the ethanol is mixed with other chemicals to form an undrinkable solution for many of these solutions there is no practical way to separate the components labels such as cannot be made nonpoisonous communicate to users that they should not trust any alcohol claiming to be rendered safe by distilling filtering or additives   in the united states the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau ttb formerly known as the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms atf regulates sales of alcoholic beverages alcoholic beverages liquor wine beer etc are heavily taxed in order to avoid paying beverage taxes on alcohol that is not meant to be consumed the alcohol must be denatured per specific formulations given by the ttb there are approximately 50 formulations provided by the ttb most of which are indeed toxic to humans but not all denatured alcohol is not in itself a preferred product â€” that is it is not something that would be normally demanded if given the alternative of normal ethanol denatured alcohol and its manufacture are a public policy compromise the supply and demand for denatured alcohol arises from the fact that normal alcohol which in everyday language refers specifically to ethanol suitable for human ingestion as a recreational drink or extractive medium for medicinal tinctures is usually very expensive in comparison with similar chemicals being highly taxed for revenue and public health policy purposes see pigovian tax if pure ethanol were made cheaply available for fuel solvents or medicinal purposes some people might ingest it denatured alcohol provides a solution to permit industrial use and manufacture of ethanol whereby cheap ethanol can be made available for non-consumption use without the risk of its being converted for consumption the process creates an ethanol-containing solution that is not suitable for drinking but is otherwise similar to ethanol for most purposes as a result there is no duty on denatured alcohol in most countries making it considerably cheaper than pure ethanol as a consequence its composition is tightly defined by government regulations that vary between countries different additives are used to make it difficult to use distillation or other simple processes to reverse the denaturation methanol is commonly used both because its boiling point is close to that of ethanol and because it is toxic another typical denaturant is pyridine often the denatured alcohol is dyed with methyl violet there are several grades of denatured alcohol but in general the denaturants used are similar as an example the formulation for completely denatured alcohol according to 2005 british regulations was as follows  completely denatured alcohol must be made in accordance with the following formulation  with every 90 parts by volume of alcohol mix 9.5 parts by volume of wood naphtha or a substitute and 0.5 parts by volume of crude pyridine and to the resulting mixture add mineral naphtha petroleum oil in the proportion of 3.75 litres to every 1000 litres of the mixture and synthetic organic dyestuff methyl violet in the proportion of 1.5 grams to every 1000 litres of the mixture the european union agreed in february 2013 to the mutual procedures for the complete denaturing of alcohol  denatured alcohol is used identically to ethanol itself except for applications that involve ingestion un-denatured ethanol is required for food and beverage applications and certain chemical reactions where the denaturant would interfere despite its poisonous content denatured alcohol is sometimes consumed as a surrogate alcohol which can result in blindness or death if as was typical it contains methanol for instance during american prohibition federal law required methanol in domestically manufactured industrial alcohols on christmas day 1926 and the two following days roughly at the midpoint of the great experiment of prohibition 31 people in new york city died of methanol poisoning to help prevent this denatonium is often added to give the substance an extremely bitter flavor substances such as pyridine help to give the mixture an unpleasant odor and emetic vomiting agents such as syrup of ipecac may also be included new zealand has removed methanol from its government-approved methylated spirits formulation consuming methylated spirits in south africa is referred to as riding the blue train as the product has a blue color
